= Introduction of the Acerbo Law

The Acerbo Law, an amendment to electoral law, has reached the floor of the Chamber of Deputies, introduced by one of the PNF's members. The change in law would result in which gained at least 25 per cent of the votes â€“ gained two-thirds of the seats in parliament. The remaining third was to be shared amongst the other parties proportionally.

This is an obvious power grab by [+ pnf_leader +], who seeks to consolidate power, and we must oppose this bill, considering the rampant violence and voter intimidation we have seen throughout the country. Already, the left-wing parties stand united in our opposition to this bill, but we have to convince the rest to do so as well. 

What should we do?

[? if acerbo_law_passed : It's a miracle; the bill dies in the Chamber of Deputes, as we are able to form a united front against fascism. [+ prime_minister +] is outraged, but we have managed to stem fascist takeover, even slightly. ?]
