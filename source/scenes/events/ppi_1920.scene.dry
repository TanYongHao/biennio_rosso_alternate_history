= 1920 PPI Congress

The *Partito Popolare Italiano*, known also as the PPI or the Italian People's Party have begun their second Congress. The party has developed significantly over the past year, and a new face has emerged within the party: Alcide De Gasperi.

While Sturzo commands the support of the Christian Democrats and the 'White' Peasant Leagues, De Gasperi is supported by Moderate Clericalists and the Clergy.

- @ppi_first: The party votes...

on-arrival: ppi_left += 2;

Unsurprisingly, Luigi Sturzo continues his leadership over the party, continuing the party's collaborative policies with the left.

@gasperi_1920

on-arrival: ppi_relation -= 7; ppi_leader = "De Gasperi"; ppi_moderates += 2;

Surprisingly, Alcide De Gasperi, with his support base, has been elected the second Secretary General of the Party. He represents a turn from the left, seeking further cooperation with the liberal parties.
