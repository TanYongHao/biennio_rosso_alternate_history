= Fascist Sympathisers in the PSI

We have caught wind of some information that some PSI leaders are sympathetic to Mussolini and his Fasces of Combat, even regardless of their threat. Should we expel them from the party?

- @expel: Expel the Sympathisers!
- @no_expel: Allow the sympathisers to remain.

@expel
subtitle: Enrico Ferri & Nicola Bombacci will be expelled!
on-arrival: sympathiser_expelled = 1; n_advisors -= 1 if ferri_advisor = 1; n_advisors -= 1 if bombacci_advisor = 1; maximalist_strength -= 6*(1-dissent); bombacci_advisor = 0; ferri_advisor = 0;

We expel the sympathisers, who turn out to be prominent members of the Maximalist faction, weakening them.

@no_expel
subtitle: Why act on baseless rumors?
on-arrival: maximalist_strength += 5*(1-dissent); workers_psi -= 3*(1-dissent); workers_bn += 5*(1-dissent); middle_class_bn += 3*(1-dissent); reformist_dissent += 5*(1-dissent); communist_dissent += 5*(1-dissent);

We allow the sympathisers in the party, though we do see our party base shrink slightly in the coming weeks.
