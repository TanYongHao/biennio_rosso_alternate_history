= Formation of the Arditi del Popolo

Reports have been flowing in about a new organisation forming in Rome. The Arditi del Popolo, formed as an anti-fascist militant organisation by former 'Arditi' members has gained significant popularity, attracting a broad popular front from the Communists of the Far-Left to the Republicans of the Centre.

The party is split on how we should react to this new organisation. The reformists advocate for broader cooperation, seeing the group as an ally against fascism and far-right paramilitaries that have been plaguing us, while the Left wing of the party has criticised the groups willingness to cooperate with non-communists in its ranks.

[? if pcdi_formed : The PCd'I has officially adopted a non-cooperative stance towards the group, ordering its members to quit the organisation and threatening those who support it with disciplinary action. ?] How should we respond?

- @adp_event_cooperation: Reach out to the Arditi and welcome further cooperation.
- @adp_event_refuse: Refuse any cooperation with the Arditi.
