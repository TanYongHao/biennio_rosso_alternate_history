= [+ year +] UL Emergency Congress

It seems recent developments within the Italian political sphere has prompted a reorientation of the Liberal Union's internal politics, as it seems a strong opposition towards [+ ul_leader +]'s leadership has been challenged. On one end is Giovanni Giolitti, a 'Centrist Liberal' who to say is controversial within the party would be an understatement, having been Prime Minister for no less than a decade, holding significant influence within the party.

On the other side, Sidney Sonnino represents the more right-wing of the party, being a 'Conservative Liberal' and historically a strong advocate of resolving the *Southern Question*.

- @ul_congress: The party votes...

@ul_congress
go-to: giolitti_elected if ul_giolitti >= ul_sonnino; sonnino_elected if ul_sonnino > ul_giolitti

@giolitti_elected
on-arrival: ul_leader = "Giolitti"; ul_sonnino -= 2;

It seems that Giovanni Giolitti has come out on top in the struggle, elected as the party's Secretary General. He continues the party's historical alignment.

@sonnino_elected
on-arrival: ul_leader = "Sonnino"; ul_giolitti -= 2; ul_relation -= 5;

It seems that Sidney Sonnino has come out on top in the leadership struggle, elected as the party's Secretary General. He continues the party's alignment, albeit with a significant emphasis on the Mezzogiorno.
