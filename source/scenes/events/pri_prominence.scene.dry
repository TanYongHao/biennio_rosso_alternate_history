= PRI regains Prominence

The *Partito Repubblicano Italiano*, known also as the Italian Republican Party, was a formidable force following the end of the 19th and early 20th century, reaching over 5% in the Chamber of Deputies, before falling into obscurity. However, it seems the party has made a comeback, primarily due to the increased support for Republicanism throughout the last couple months.

Whatever the case, the PRI have been our historic allies, [? if participating = 1:and we are optimistic to renew the bonds between our parties to be a strong force in politics. ?][? if not_participating = 1:it seems it will have to come to an end. ?]

- @root: Time will tell what this new force will do.
