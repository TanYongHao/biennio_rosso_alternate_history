= [+ year +] [+ ldr_Name +] Emergency Congress

The PLI has been formed, and with it the first Congress has begun to elect the party's Secretary General. On one end is Francesco Saverio Nitti, a Centrist Liberal[? if not prime_minister = "Nitti": and former Prime Minister.?][? if prime_minister = "Nitti" : who currently is the Prime Minister.?] He aligns with the moderate to left-wing of the party, though that isn't to say he'd be willing to work with us in the slightest.

On the other end is Antonio Salandra, a Right-wing Liberal and former Prime Minister, as well as the man responsible for bring Italy into the war. He represents the right-wing of the faction, and seems to be somewhat favourable to Mussolini and his ragtag gang of Fascists. Caught in the middle is Vittorio Emanuele Orlando, a 'Liberal Democrat' and former Prime Minister once more, and the man who led Italy out of the war. He represents the moderate wing of the party, in between the two other candidates.

- @pli_congress: The party votes...
- @pli_resources: Utilise our funds to campaign in favour of Nitti.

It seems that, fortunately, Nitti has come out on top as the party leader in the first Congress, elected as the party's Secretary General. He is expected to continue the party's liberal's alignment, though he seems at the very least willing to negotiate with us.

on-arrival: ldr_leader = "Orlando"; ldr_left -= 2; ldr_right -= 2;

It seems that Vittorio Emanuele Orlando has come out on top in the Congress, elected as the party's Secretary General. He continues the party's historic alignment and the status-quo.

@salandra_elected_1921
on-arrival: ldr_leader = "Salandra"; ldr_left -= 2; ldr_moderates -= 2; ldr_relation -= 5;

Antonio Salandra, unfortunately, has been elected as the Secretary General. He will continue the party's ideological alignment with liberalism, albeit with a willingness to be friendly to the right against us.
