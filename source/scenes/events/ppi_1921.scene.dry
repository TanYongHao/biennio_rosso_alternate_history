= 1921 PPI Congress

The *Partito Popolare Italiano*, known also as the PPI or the Italian People's Party have begun their third Congress. The party continues its two factional bloc, with Sturzo on the left-wing of the party and De Gasperi representing moderate wing of the party.

While Sturzo commands the support of the Christian Democrats and the 'White' Peasant Leagues, De Gasperi is supported by Moderate Clericalists and the Clergy.

- @ppi_1920: The party votes...

@ppi_1920
go-to: sturzo_1920 if ppi_left > ppi_moderates; gasperi_1920 if ppi_moderates > ppi_left; triumvirate_1921 if ppi_left == ppi_moderates

@sturzo_1921

on-arrival: ppi_left += 2; ppi_relation += 2; ppi_leader = "Sturzo"

It seems the progressives have managed to sway the party, as Luigi Sturzo is elected Secretary General of the party once again, re-continuing the party's collaborative policies with the left.

@gasperi_1921
face-image: img/portraits/DeGasperi.jpg
on-arrival: ppi_relation -= 7; ppi_leader = "De Gasperi"; ppi_moderates += 2;

Alcide De Gasperi, with his support base, has been elected the third Secretary General of the Party. Representing a turn from the left, the PPI will cooperate further with the liberal parties.

@triumvirate_1921
on-arrival: ppi_left -= 2; ppi_moderates -= 1; ppi_leader = "Triumvirate"; Q.ppi_right += 2;

Surprisingly, neither Sturzo nor De Gasperi have been able to acquire a majority to be elected, and have acceded to a compromise non-partisan Triumvirate of Gronchi, Spataro and Rodin√≤.
