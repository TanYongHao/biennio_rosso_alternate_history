= Occupation of Fiume

Gabriele D'Annunzio, a poet and officer of the Regio Esercito, along with his "legionaries", have seized control of the city of Fiume from Entente occupying forces, declaring the "Italian Regency of Carnaro" and demanding Italy annex the city. 

This has caused quite a stir internationally, and will certainly delay the resolution of our negotiations with Yugoslavia.

We issue a letter of condemnation of D'Annunzio, even as not much of the party agrees.
