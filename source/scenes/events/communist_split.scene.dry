= Left-wing members split

Our policy choices have greatly offended the left, seeing our turn against revolutionary theory, and many of their leaders have split to form a new party, the PCd'I, or the Communist Party of Italy. They do not count a huge section of our membership, but unfortunately were making up an unequal amount of the Red Guards.
