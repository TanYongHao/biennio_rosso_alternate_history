= The Roman Question

Following the Risorgimento, the newly formed Kingdom of Italy seized Rome from the Holy See, as the Pope declared himself 'Prisoner of the Vatican'. Though attempts have been made to resolve this issue since, the situation has largely not changed. 

Now that we are in power, we might be able to resolve this issue with the Holy See.
