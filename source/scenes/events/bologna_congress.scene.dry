= XVI Congress of the Italian Socialist Party

The XVI Congress of Bologna has officially begun. Though the Congress wil be have many debates and discussions on the future of the party, there are two main things to be discussed: deciding on an approach to advance the proletarian revolution and participation in the new November elections. 

**This will decide the path you will take.**

The first thing on the agenda is to decide between a reformist or revolutionary approach. The Reformists are staunch advocates of parliamentary action to achieve a socialist state, while the Communists and majority of the Maximalists advocate for revolutionary action to achieve a Soviet Republic.

-@revolutionary_approach: The Communist and Left-Maximalists sway enough of the party in their favour.
-@maximalist_approach: The Right-Communists and Maximalists are able to establish a compromise that forms a majority.
-@reformist_approach: The Reformists are able to sway enough of the Right-Maximalists to achieve a shocking majority.

@revolutionary_approach
subtitle: The party will fully abandon parliamentary means and pursue a policy of violent revolution.
choose-if: communist_strength > reformist_strength
unavailable-subtitle: The bulk of the party are opposed to this.
on-arrival: reformist_dissent += 20; reformist_strength -= 10; communist_strength += 15; maximalist_strength += 10; communist_dissent -= 20; maximalist_dissent -= 15; not_participating = 1; revolutionary_fervor += 5; king_relation -= 5; party_approach = "Revolutionary";
go-to: @election_agenda

This result only seems to exacerbate the friction within the party, as Reformist members storm out of the Congress as the results of the votes is announced.

@maximalist_approach
subtitle: The party will stay the course of revolution via extraparliamentary ways, but will not fully abandon parliamentary means.
on-arrival: reformist_dissent += 10; reformist_strength -= 5; communist_strength -= 5; maximalist_strength += 5; communist_dissent += 10; maximalist_dissent -= 10;
go-to: @election_agenda

The less radical members of the Communists and Reformists accept the result, whilst the more radical members express their outrage over this effective 'appeasement' to keep the party together.

@reformist_approach
choose-if: communist_strength < reformist_strength
unavailable-subtitle: The bulk of the party are opposed to this.
subtitle: The party will fully abandon extraparliamentary means and pursue a policy of parliamentary reform.
on-arrival: reformist_dissent -= 20; reformist_strength += 10; communist_strength -= 15; maximalist_strength -= 10; communist_dissent += 20; maximalist_dissent += 15; participating = 1; revolutionary_fervor -= 10; king_relation += 5; party_approach = "Parliamentary";
go-to: @election_agenda

The Reformists, having lost leadership in 1912, are able to achieve a plurality through the vote, stunning many who saw the Reformists as having lost most of its support within the party. Already, as the vote is announced, Many Communist and Maximalist members storm out of the Congress, leaving the Reformists to continue the Congress.

The second and final thing on the agenda is whether or not the PSI should participate in the November elections. The Reformists advocate for full participation, the Maximists token participation and the Communists full abstention.

- @communist_arguments: The Communists are able to convince the rest of the party against the bourgeois elections.
- @maximalist_arguments: The Maximalists utilise their majority to convince the rest of the party to compromise.
- @reformist_arguments: The Reformists are able to eek through with support from the sympathetic Maximalist members.

@communist_arguments
subtitle: The party will fully refuse to participate in the upcoming election.
choose-if: participating = 0
unavailable-subtitle: [? if participating = 1 : We have already chosen to achieve socialism via parliamentary means. ?]
on-arrival: reformist_dissent += 20; reformist_strength -= 10; communist_strength += 15; maximalist_strength += 10; communist_dissent -= 20; maximalist_dissent -= 15; not_participating = 1;

The Communists are able to convince the Maximalists that wasting time on participating is a futile use of time, as the party votes for full abstention in the upcoming elections.

@maximalist_arguments
subtitle: The party will participate, but not form coalitions with the bourgeois parties.
choose-if: not_participating = 0
unavailable-subtitle: [? if not_participating = 1: We have already chosen to abandon the reformist approach. ?]
on-arrival: reformist_dissent += 10; reformist_strength -= 5; communist_strength -= 5; maximalist_strength += 5; communist_dissent += 10; maximalist_dissent -= 20; maximalist_participating = 1;

The Maximalist majority secures a compromise solution, agreeing to participate in the upcoming elections but refusing any sort of coalition with the bourgeois parties. 

@reformist_arguments
choose-if: not_participating = 0
unavailable-subtitle: [? if not_participating = 1 : We have already chosen to achieve socialism via extraparliamentary ways. ?]
subtitle: The party will fully participate in the upcoming election.
on-arrival: reformist_dissent -= 20; reformist_strength += 10; communist_strength -= 15; maximalist_strength -= 10; communist_dissent += 20; maximalist_dissent += 15; participating = 1;

The Reformists are able to convince sympathetic Maximalist members to support their endeavour to participate in the November elections and form a coalition with the bourgeois parties. The Communists and remaining Maximalists are unsurprisingly, outraged.
