= Investigating Domestic Enemies

As we have control over the Interior Ministry, we can direct police and intelligence services to investigate internal enemies. We can proscribe various organisations.

- @ban_fdc: Ban the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento.
- @unban_fdc: Unban the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento.
- @persecute_fdc
- @ban_ard: Ban the Arditi.
- @unban_ard: Unban the Arditi.
- @persecute_ard
- @root: Take no action for now. [? if fasci_urgency < 3 : It's not like the far-right pose a threat. ?]

@ban_fdc
view-if: fasci_urgency >= 3 and fdc_banned == 0
on-arrival: fdc_strength *= 0.85; fdc_strength *= 0.7 if interior_police_loyalty >= 0.7; fdc_banned = 1; ul_relation -= 3; interior_police_loyalty -= 0.05; fdc_militancy -= 0.05; fdc_ban_timer = 6;

As it turns out, the Fasci have many allies in the police and bureaucracy. Our relationship with the Carabinieri weakens, and the Fasci can still organize illegally, right under the police's noses. [? if interior_police_loyalty >= 0.7 : Nevertheless, the Fasci is substantially weakened by our ban. ?]

@unban_fdc
view-if: fdc_banned == 1
on-arrival: fdc_banned = 0; fdc_strength += 15; fdc_militancy += 0.05

The Fasci is no longer banned. They immediately go on a recruiting spree.

on-arrival: fdc_strength *= 0.7; fdc_militancy -= 0.05

We have arrested more of the Fasci's leaders and confiscated their weapons.

view-if: fasci_urgency >= 3 and ard_banned == 0

Banning the Arditi weakens our relationship with the political right and the police. In addition, the Arditi still operates out of public sight.

@unban_ard
view-if: ard_banned == 1
on-arrival: ard_banned = 0; ard_strength += 5

The Arditi is no longer banned.

on-arrival: ard_strength *= 0.7; ard_militancy -= 0.05; dvp_relation -= 5; interior_police_loyalty -= 0.05;

view-if: fasci_urgency >= 3 and abl_banned == 0

Banning the Anti-Bolshevik League's weakens our relationship with the landowners and industrialists.

@unban_abl
view-if: abl_banned == 1
on-arrival: abl_banned = 0; abl_strength += 5

The Anti-Bolshevik Leagues are no longer banned.
