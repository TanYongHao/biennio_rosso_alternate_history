[? if interior_minister_party = "PSI": Being in control of the Interior Ministry, we hold control of the Carabinieri, the national gendarmerie, alongside the Defence Ministry, we can take care of the unstable internal situation of Italy. ?]

[? if liberal_crackdown_accepted and not interior_minister_party = "PSI" : Although not in control of the Interior Ministry, our coalition partners have given us temporary control over matters of the Carabinieri. ?]

on-arrival: interior_police_loyalty += 0.1;

With some specific reassignments and improved training methods, we can root out reactionary and sympathetic fascist influence within the Carabinieri.

Current Carabinieri loyalty: [+ interior_police_loyalty : loyalty +]

@investigate_corruption
view-if: interior_minister_party = "PSI"
go-to: investigate_corruption_success if interior_police_loyalty >= 0.5; investigate_corruption_failure if interior_police_loyalty < 0.5

@investigate_corruption_success
on-arrival: investigate_corruption += 1; workers_psi += 5*(1-dissent); inflation -= 0.1 if inflation > 3; inflation -= 0.2 if inflation >= 8

Corruption in big business is rampant, of course. We have uncovered a number of scandals, and publicizing them brings new attention to the work of Interior Minister [+ interior_minister +], building up his popular appeal and that of the PSI.

@investigate_corruption_failure

Unfortunately, our investigations have failed to turn up anything. Rumors are that the targets of our investigation were tipped off by infiltrators within the Carabinieri.

@crackdown_far_right
go-to: crackdown_far_right_success if interior_police_loyalty >= 0.5; crackdown_far_right_failure if interior_police_loyalty < 0.5

@crackdown_far_right_success
on-arrival: crackdown_far_right += 1 if liberal_crackdown_accepted; ard_strength -= 5; fdc_strength -= 5; liberal_crackdown_complete = 1 if crackdown_far_left > 0;

A number of coordinated raids and arrests have slightly paralysed the far-right paramilitaries.

@crackdown_far_right_failure

Unfortunately, our raids have turned up empty, our arrest warrants stalled. Rumors are that the targets of our investigation were tipped off by infiltrators within the Carabinieri.

@crackdown_far_left
go-to: crackdown_far_left_success if interior_police_loyalty >= 0.5; crackdown_far_left_failure if interior_police_loyalty < 0.5

@crackdown_far_left_success
on-arrival: crackdown_far_left += 1 if liberal_crackdown_accepted; rg_strength -= 5; communist_dissent += 10*(1-dissent); liberal_crackdown_complete = 1 if crackdown_far_right > 0;

A number of coordinated raids and arrests have slightly paralysed the far-left paramilitaries, as well as orders from party leadership to downsize the Red Guards. The left-wing of the party isn't exactly enthused about our decision, to say the least.

@crackdown_far_left_failure

Unfortunately, our raids have turned up empty, our arrest warrants stalled. Rumors are that the targets of our investigation were tipped off by infiltrators within the Carabinieri.
