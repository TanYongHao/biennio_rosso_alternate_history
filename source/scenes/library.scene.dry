@government
go-to: menu

The Kingdom of Italy, also known as Italy, is a Constitutional Monarchy under a King and a Bicameral Parliament, composing the appointed Senate and the elective Chamber of Deputies. The Chamber is responsible for governing, while the King has a largely ceremonial role as well as a few important responsibilities. 

The Chamber of Deputies is elected based on a proportional representation voting system, apportioning 508-535 seats based on the D'Hondt method, added alongside newly introduced universal male suffrage. The King then appoints the Prime Minister and Cabinet, usually under the request of the Chamber of Deputies. A majority vote-of-no-confidence can remove the current government, though a new coalition is typically formed utilising the same composition of the Chamber of Deputies.

Italy is divided into a number of states, each of which have their own governments with some responsibilities, albeit insignificant.

= Timeline of the PSI and the Kingdom (until 1919)

**1861**: The Kingdom of Italy is officially unified and established as a nation-state under a Constitutional Monarch.

**1892**: The PSI is officially founded in Genoa, caused by the rise of labour, socialism and dissatisfaction with the political system. It is divided between the Reformists & Revolutionaries, growing throughout the rest of the Century into a coalition of Communists to Social Democrats.

**1889**: Protests are violently suppressed by the Italian government, leading to political radicalisation of the working class and an increase in PSI popularity.

**1900**: King Umberto I is assassinated by an anarchist, further heightening tensions.

**1914**: World War One begins. Parties are divided on the Italian stance towards the war, though the PSI adopts a neutrality stance against the war and opposes any intervention in the conflict.

**1915**: Italy joins World War One on the side of the Entente after signing the Treaty of London The PSI fractures as more radical members supported the war whilst others remained anti-war, resulting in members like Benito Mussolini being kicked out of the party.

**1917**: Increased war exhaustion and discontent increases the PSI's popularity, as many become frustrated with Italy's involvement in World War One.

**1919**: World War One ends.
