= Judiciary Reform

The Judiciary is one of the most reactionary components of the government, along with the military. Many jurists have held office since the days of the Risorgimento. They give violent fascists on the right laughably light sentences, while ruthlessly persecuting leftists and pacifists for lesser crimes.

[? if judicial_reform <= 0 : There is great demand in our membership for reforming the judiciary, although this may bring us into a collision course with our coalition allies. ?]
[? if judicial_reform == 1 : We have started on the path to judicial reform. While some of the most antediluvian and biased justices have been replaced, many still remain. More should be done. ?]
[? if judicial_reform >= 2 : We have successfully reformed the judiciary, to some extent. At the very least, the courts will not actively obstruct our attempts to prosecute crimes committed by the far-right. ?]

- @reform: Carry out substantial judicial reforms,
- @minor_reforms: Carry out minor judicial reforms.
- @as_is: Leave the judiciary as it is.

subtitle: -1 budget [? if liberal_budget_accepted and budget <= 0 : This will put us into a deficit! ?]

We investigate jurists who have shown themselves to have biased or corrupt behavior, and try to remove them, replacing them with more democratically-oriented jurists. This obviously raises quite a great deal of ire in conservative circles, including within our coalition.

on-arrival: democratisation += 1; workers_psi += 3*(1-dissent) if democratisation >= 3; judicial_reform += 1; republican_sentiment += 3*(1-dissent);

We try to remove the most obviously biased and corrupt jurists, while leaving most of the system intact. It is slow work reforming the judiciary.
