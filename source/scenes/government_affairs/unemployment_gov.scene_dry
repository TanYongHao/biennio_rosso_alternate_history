= Dealing with Unemployment

The economic situation within Italy after the war is worsening after the previous government dragged us into a senseless war. With the demobilisation of the army, combined with debts piling, our unemployment rate stands at [+ unemployment +]%.

There are various ways we are able to tackle this problem now that we are in government, with proposals from numerous parties reaching the floor. What should we do?

# most of these will need to have a ministry involved as well; public works, labour & social security, financial respectively; last one is unpopular amongst party

- @public_works_program: Continue the expansion of infrastructure projects.
- @tax_breaks: Increase tax breaks and loans given to businesses and cooperatives.
- @no_aid: Our budget limits our ability to aid the unemployed.

We have increased funding to the Public Works Ministry, who have begun drafting up plans and hiring workers for further infrastructure projects.

[? if ldr_promise_failed : Unfortunately, increasing funding has led us to enter a deficit, breaking our agreement with the Liberals, and their representatives have already requested a meeting with us. ?]

This is an unpopular move within the party, and is seen handouts to petite-bourgeois voters. The loans however, are able to keep businesses afloat temporarily[? if centre_left_coalition : and our coalition partners seem satisfied. ?] [? if not centre_left_coalition:. ?]
