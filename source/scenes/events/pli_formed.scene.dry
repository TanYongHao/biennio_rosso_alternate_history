= Formation of the Italian Liberal Party

The Liberal Union, also known as Unione Liberale, under Giovanni Giolitti, has reorganised itself under a new party, known as the Italian Liberal Party. The party still represents its former ideals, though it seems to be significantly more friendly to our enemies in the far-right.
