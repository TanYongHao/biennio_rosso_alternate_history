= [+ pnf_leader +] Appointed Prime Minister!

The March on Rome has succeeded, as the threat of violence and outright civil war forces the King to give in to [+ pnf_leader +]'s demands. Vittorio Emanuele III has officially appointed [+ pnf_leader +] as Prime Minister, as many fear he will quickly consolidate power and bring the full force of the government towards us.

[+ pnf_leader +] has already formed a governing coalition of the PNF, PPI, PLI and DS.

What are we to do now?

- @fight: Mobilise the Red Guards and authorise workers to begin taking up arms against [+ pnf_leader +]'s rule!
- @keep_on: Await our opportunity to strike.


@fight

Do we realize that this means civil war, against the full force of the state?

- @civil_war: Yes.
- @keep_on: We are not ready for war. Instead, we will continue to struggle and await our opportunity.

@keep_on
subtitle: This will not end the game.

We will continue onwards, biding our time. We are facing an extremely uphill battle, and will have to act fast.
