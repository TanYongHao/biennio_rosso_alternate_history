= XVII Congress of the Italian Socialist Party

Debates and speeches from many are heard, as differing voices voice their opinions to the crowd. The 17th Congress of the Italian Socialist Party has begun. The agenda on the table is the 21 new conditions by the Communist International, of which one has stood out: The expelling of the reformists, now considered counter-revolutionaries.

The Maximalists are caught in the centre, as the Communists and Reformists argue whether or not to toe the International line. It seems the party can no longer hold with compromise, one faction has to go.

- @refuse_comintern: The PSI must stand with its reformists. They will not be expelled.
- @accept_comintern: The PSI must toe the Communist International line. The Reformists will be expelled.

[? if communists_split = 1 : Even as the communist faction remains minimal after the founding of the Italian Communist Party, ?] The communist faction has resigned, with the majority [? if communists_split = 1 : joining the existing PCI. ?][? if communists_split = 0 : creating a new party called the Italian Communist Party. ?] 

The Communist International has also expelled us, supporting the new PCI instead; it seems we can no longer rely on them for aid.
