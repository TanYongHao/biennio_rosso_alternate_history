@bank_deficit

= Banca d'Italia warns of deficit

It seems we have inherited a deficit from the previous government. We should be cautious not to continue borrowing significantly, else we end up in a fiscal crisis.

@bank_balanced

= Banca d'Italia informs on balanced budget

It seems the previous government has managed to balance the budget, even in the current economic situation. Nevertheless, we inherit a stable budget, though it might be encouraged to allow some deficit spending to resolve our economy.

@bank_surplus

= Banca d'Italia informs of surplus

It seems the previous government has somehow been able to resolve our debt issues, even as the current economic crisis continues. Regardless, it seems we are allowed a great deal of room to act and spend.
