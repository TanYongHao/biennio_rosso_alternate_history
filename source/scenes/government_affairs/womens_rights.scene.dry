= Women's Rights

According to the Constitution, women are equal to men, but this is not followed in practice. Women in the workforce are not paid equally for the same work, in addition to often being pushed out of employment after marriage. Men are still favored in marriage and family policy, and there are restrictions on women's rights in many other domains. And that is not to mention the overwhelming patriarchal culture present in Italy.

For better or for worse, the Socialists stand virtually alone in supporting increased rights for women, and even within the party, the leadership does not consider it a priority. [? if psi_r < 50 : Unfortunately, women still disproportionately support the bourgeois parties. ?]

- @labour: Institute policies that help women in the workforce.
- @family: Reform marriage, divorce, and property law.
- @welfare: Improve welfare for single mothers and children.
- @liberalize: Attempt to liberalize abortion laws.
- @suffrage: Attempt to pass women's suffrage.
- @return: Do not enact any policies for now.

These policies mean that our party is increasing in popularity among the "new women" who work outside the home. [? if unemployment > 15 : However, many male workers develop a backlash towards women in the workplace, especially given the rising unemployment. ?]

@family
subtitle: Change family and inheritance law to treat women more equally.
on-arrival: family_law += 1; womens_rights += 1; middle_class_psi += 2*(1-dissent); workers_psi += 3*(1-dissent); industrialists_psi -= 2; rural_psi -= 2; catholics_psi -= 4; coalition_dissent += 1 if socialist_catholic_coalition; ppi_relation -= 4; ppi_moderates += 0.1
max-visits: 2

These policies aim to ensure that women have equal rights within a marriage, including the right to divorce. The more conservative segments of society treat our reforms as deleterious to the social fabric.

@welfare
subtitle: -1 Budget [? if budget < 1 and liberal_budget_accepted : This will put us into a deficit! ?]
on-arrival: welfare += 1; workers_psi += 5*(1-dissent); veterans_psi += 5*(1-dissent); budget -= 1; womens_rights += 1; coalition_dissent += 1 if (welfare >= 1 and unemployment >= 15); unemployment -= 0.4; inflation += 0.2; economic_growth += 0.3; ldr_promise_failed = 1 if (current_budget >= 0 and budget < 0 and liberal_budget_accepted == 1)
go-to: ldr_promise_vonc if ldr_promise_failed = 1

We have increased welfare spending on women and children. [? if welfare >= 1 and unemployment >= 15 : Some of our coalition partners consider increased welfare spending profligate at this time. ?]

@liberalize_fail
on-arrival: ppi_relation -= 5; coalition_dissent += 1 if socialist_catholic_coalition; workers_psi += 3*(1-dissent); catholics_psi -= 5; ppi_moderates += 1;

Unfortunately, our proposal is voted down in the Chamber of Deputies, with the Italian People's Party speaking in particularly vehement opposition, and some of our own members breaking party discipline. The activists, feeling demoralized from this attempt, have decided to bide their time.

With the support of the left including the PSI and PSRI, we have successfully passed a bill to legalize abortion in Italy! This has heartened our more progressive supporters, while hurting our relations with the People's Party. With the increasing political discourse around abortion, the religiously-oriented People's Party and [+ ul_full_name +] have gained conservative votes at the expense of the [+ pnf_name +].

With the support of the left including the PSRI [? if pri_prominent:the PRI?], we have successfully passed a bill to allow women to vote in Italy! This has heartened our more radical supporters, while hurting our relations with the Liberal parties. With the increasing political discourse around suffrage, the [+ ldr_full_name +] and [+ ul_full_name +] have gained middle class and landowner votes at the expense of the [+ pnf_name +].
