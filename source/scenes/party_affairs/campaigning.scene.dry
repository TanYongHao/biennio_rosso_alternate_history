= Campaigning

Whether or not we are in an electoral campaign, the party is always trying to broaden its voter base. Who should we focus our campaign efforts on?

- @workers: The urban working class, our traditional support base.
- @middle_class: The middle class of small independent businessmen and artisans.
- @industrialists: The industrialists and landowners who traditionally oppose us.
- @rural: Rural workers and small farmers, who have felt neglected by us in the past.
- @veterans: Newly unemployed veterans discharged from the army.
- @catholics: Catholics, who typically support the People's Party.
- @root: We either don't want to or cannot campaign right now.
- @easy_discard
